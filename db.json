is the main goal of the blog","date":"2022-08-26T08:18:39.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What is the main goal of the blog? \n\nOne of the main goals of this blog is to provide quality resources and information for people who are looking to improve their lives. Whether it’s through developing better personal habits, acquiring new skills or gaining knowledge on important topics, we aim to provide our readers with the tools they need to make positive changes in their lives.\n\n# Who writes for the blog? \n\nThe blog is written by a team of contributors who come from a variety of backgrounds and have a range of interests and expertise. We all share a passion for personal growth and self-improvement, and we hope to pass on some of the knowledge and insights that we’ve acquired through our own journey of growth.\n\n# What can I expect to find on the blog? \n\nThe blog covers a wide range of topics related to personal development, including productivity, health & fitness, relationships, financial literacy, career growth, self-awareness and more. We also feature interviews with inspiring individuals who have achieved success in various fields, as well as practical tips and advice from experts in various fields.\n\n# Why should I read the blog? \n\nWe believe that everyone has the potential for greatness and that everyone can benefit from personal growth. By reading the blog, you will gain access to valuable information and resources that can help you live a happier, healthier and more positive life.\n\n#  Who created the blog? \nBloggers are people who write articles and post them on the internet for other people to read. There are many different types of bloggers, but most blogs fall into one of two categories: personal or professional.\n\nPersonal bloggers write about their own lives, while professional bloggers offer information or opinion on a particular topic. Some bloggers start out writing personal blogs and eventually switch to professional blogging, while others maintain both personal and professional blogs simultaneously.\n\nThe first blog is believed to have been started in 1994 by Justin Hall, who called it “ links.net .” Hall was a student at Swarthmore College at the time, and he used the blog to document his life and share links to interesting websites he came across.\n\nSince then, the blogosphere has exploded with new content and ideas. There are now millions of blogs online, covering every possible topic you can think of. So whatever your interest is, there’s probably a blog out there that covers it in depth.\n\nSo who creates these blogs? The answer is anyone with something to say and the desire to share it with the world. Whether you’re a stay-at-home mom looking for a way to connect with other parents, a freelance writer trying to build your portfolio, or just someone with a lot of opinions and something to say, blogging can be a great way to express yourself!\n\n#  How often is it updated? \nIn the WordPress ecosystem, one of the common questions asked by users is how often a plugin or theme is updated. This is generally a good indicator of the quality of a plugin or theme. If it has not been updated in a while, it may be abandoned by its developer and contains known security vulnerabilities.\n\nWhen assessing how frequently a plugin or theme is updated, there are two main types of updates to consider: major and minor. A major update is usually reserved for significant changes, such as adding new features, redesigning the user interface (UI), or fixing bugs. On the other hand, a minor update typically includes bug fixes and small enhancements.\n\nMost WordPress plugins and themes are released with minor updates shortly after they are initially created. However, some developers take much longer to release an update - sometimes years! This can be concerning for users who want to ensure that their site remains secure and performant.\n\nThankfully, there are several ways to determine how often a plugin or theme is updated. One method is to check the Plugin or Theme Directory on WordPress.org. Simply click on the \"Version Info\" link under each listing to see when the latest version was released. If it's been over two months since a new version was released, there's a good chance that the author has abandoned the project.\n\nAnother great way to determine how often a plugin or theme is updated is by using PlugPlotter, which was created by Tom McFarlin, developer at Pressware and co-host of WordPress Weekly. PlugPlotter aggregates data from GitHub repositories to show when new commits have been made - indicating that an update has been released. It also indicates whether these commits are major or minor updates.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshot below, Tom's Slider Revolution plugin has had numerous commits in recent weeks (indicated by the green circles). This suggests that there have been several minor updates released for this plugin. In fact, if you mouse over one of the green circles, you can see that there was a commit on January 1st which was classified as a \"minor update.\"\n\n \n\n  \n  As you can see from PlugPlotter, most of Tom's plugins have multiple commits per week (indicating minor updates).
