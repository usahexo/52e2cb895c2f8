This makes him exactly 41 years old when he filmed Casino Royale.</p>
<h1 id="Daniel-Craig’s-Casino-Royale-Performance"><a href="#Daniel-Craig’s-Casino-Royale-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Daniel Craig’s Casino Royale Performance"></a>Daniel Craig’s Casino Royale Performance</h1><p>Casino Royale is a 2006 spy film, the 21st in the Eon Productions James Bond film series, and the first to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis &amp; Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, it is the sixth-installment of the franchise.</p>
<p>Craig’s performance was more than well received by fans and critics alike, with many citing it as one of the best Bonds ever. The Guardian said “Daniel Craig electrifies Casino Royale”, and Richard Corliss of Time called him “the definitive James Bond”.</p>
<p>In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott wrote “The new Bond is a tougher, more thoughtful character than his predecessors, and Mr. Craig, with his lazy blue eyes and air of grubby determination, is perfect for the job.” Similarly effusive was Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman who wrote “Craig makes a superb Bond … he creates a chilly power vacuum that proves irresistible.”</p>
<p>However not everyone was as impressed with Craig’s performance with Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian giving the actor only two out of five stars. Whilst he admired Craig’s toughness and noted that he “hits harder than any Bond since Sean Connery”, he felt that at times he lacked the suavity possessed by some of his predecessors.</p>
<h1 id="How-The-Actor-Daniel-Craig-Prepared-For-Casino-Royale"><a href="#How-The-Actor-Daniel-Craig-Prepared-For-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="How The Actor Daniel Craig Prepared For Casino Royale"></a>How The Actor Daniel Craig Prepared For Casino Royale</h1><p>Daniel Craig had to bulk up and get in shape for his role as James Bond in the 2006 movie Casino Royale. In order to achieve a fit and muscular physique, Craig followed a rigorous workout routine and ate a healthy diet.</p>
<p>Craig began his training regimen two months before filming started. He worked out for two hours per day, six days per week. His workout routine consisted of weightlifting, boxing, and cardio exercises.</p>
<p>To help him achieve a muscular body, Craig ate a balanced diet that was high in protein and low in carbs. He drank plenty of water and avoided processed foods and sugary drinks.</p>
<p>By following this strict diet and exercise program, Craig was able to dramatically transform his body and become the Bond we all know and love.</p>
<h1 id="Behind-The-Scenes-Of-Casino-Royale"><a href="#Behind-The-Scenes-Of-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="Behind The Scenes Of Casino Royale"></a>Behind The Scenes Of Casino Royale</h1><p>Casino Royale is a 2006 spy film, the twenty-first in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions. It is the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming’s 1953 novel of the same name, following the 1954 television adaptation and the 1967 film version.</p>
<p>Directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis &amp; Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, Casino Royale stars Daniel Craig as James Bond and Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. Filming took place at Pinewood Studios, with locations in Czech Republic, Italy and the Bahamas. The shoot concluded at Barrandov Studios in Prague.</p>
<p>Casino Royale premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 14 November 2006. It received largely positive reviews, with critics commenting on Craig’s performance as well as the action sequences, pacing, humor and tone of the film. It was simultaneously released in cinemas and IMAX theaters worldwide; 10 days after its UK premiere it had grossed over $US100 million ($111 million), making it Sony Pictures’ highest-grossing film to date (not accounting for inflation). It became the highest-grossing James Bond movie until Skyfall surpassed it in 2012.</p>
<p>The video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 includes a level called “No Russian” which was based on Casino Royale; the player assumes the role of an undercover CIA agent who participates in a massacre of Russians civilians at an airport to gain terrorist group’s trust.</p>
<h1 id="The-History"><a href="#The-History" class="headerlink" title="The History"></a>The History</h1><p>Casino Royale was adapted from a 1953 Ian Fleming novel of the same name, who also wrote Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and fourteen other James Bond novels. In 1954 Fleming wrote a screenplay for a possible adaptation but gave up after two years because he did not think anyone would want to see a “low budget” version of his book. In 1961 producer Charles Feldman signed an agreement with rights holder Independent-International Pictures to make a film version which would star Peter Sellers as Bond with Orson Welles as Le Chiffre. A successive attempt by Kevin McClory to make a competing Sellers vehicle also failed but Feldman retained rights to McClory’s footage which he eventually used for 1983’s Never Say Never Again which starred Sean Connery opposite Kim Basinger. </p>
<p>In 1990 producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli acquired all rights to all versions of Casino Royale from Feldman and started development of production based on their remake agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment while Negotiations with McClory’s representatives led to an agreement that allowed McClory creative input into future versions of Casino Royale provided that he did not receive any financial compensation beyond providing some executive producer credit.[4] This led to Eon’s 2006 release of Casino Royale which became Columbia Pictures’ highest-grossing Canadian film ever when unadjusted for inflation.[5] McClory passed away on 20 March 2006,[6] two months before Casino Royale was released.[7] </p>
<p>Wilson has stated that he did not want Daniel Craig to be pigeonholed into playing only British secret agents such as John Steed or Simon Templar.[8] The decision to reboot instead of continue with Roger Moore followed comments by director Quentin Tarantino that Moore’s portrayal ruinedJames Bond movies for young people today because “he stopped being cool”.[9][10] In early interviews following his casting Craig made clear his intentions to do more than simply emulate Sean Connery stating “I’m not doing this typecasting.”[11] Producer Barbara Broccoli noted that Craig embodied some elements of both Timothy Dalton (who played Bond in Licence To Kill) and Roger Moore.[12] </p>
<p>The 24th instalment in EON Productions’s long-running spy franchise went back before its latest reboot with this high octane big screen adaption loosely based on Ian Fleming’s very first 007 outing - released back in 1953!  Directed by Martin Campbell (GoldenEye), Casino Royale brought back original producer Charles Feldman’s merger between cinema and IMAX formats - quite groundbreaking back then - while also introducing Daniel Craig (Layer Cake) as Britain’s most lethal weapon; his 6th time playing Agent 007 throughout this huge motion picture adventure replete with breathless action set pieces (the buffalo stampede alone must have taken weeks&#x2F;months worth of planning!) across beautiful European filming locations including The Czech Republic, Italy and The Bahamas doubling up for Montenegro where Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen - Hannibal) plots against Western economic interests during an epic card game within iconic 007 surroundings such as The Texas Hold ‘Em tournament at Miami Airport or taking scenic helicopter rides above Lake Como!  Ironically -given how some fans moaned about it post-release- Spectre director Sam Mendes originally turned down helming Quantum Of Solace due partly to prior commitments but mainly being awarded an Executive Producer credit here together with Michael G Wilson &amp; Barbara Broccoli after serving them so well during</p>
<h1 id="What-Made-Daniel-Craig’s-Performance-In-Casino-Royale-So-Good"><a href="#What-Made-Daniel-Craig’s-Performance-In-Casino-Royale-So-Good" class="headerlink" title="What Made Daniel Craig’s Performance In Casino Royale So Good"></a>What Made Daniel Craig’s Performance In Casino Royale So Good</h1><p>Casino Royale is a 2006 spy film, the twenty-first in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis &amp; Robert Wade and Paul Haggis.</p>
<p>The film was produced by Barbara Broccoli, Michael G. Wilson, and Daniel Craig. Casino Royale is set at the beginning of Bond’s career as Agent 007, just after he has earned his license to kill. The plot sees Bond on an assignment to bankrupt terrorist financier Le Chiffre in a high-stakes poker game; during the game, Bond falls in love with Vesper Lynd, who is drafted into service as his partner. Casino Royale grossed $594 million worldwide. It became the highest-grossing James Bond film until Skyfall surpassed it in November 2012.</p>
<p>Critics responded positively to Craig’s performance – with American critic Roger Ebert saying that “Craig makes a superb Bond … who gives a tough, searing performance that shakes off decades of cliche”. Citation Dafna Zur: “Daniel Craig: From Learner Driver to Hollywood Hero” The Daily Telegraph 19 October 2006: n. pag.&lt; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/1539359/Daniel-Craig-From-Learner-Driver-to-Hollywood-Hero.html&gt;">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/1539359/Daniel-Craig-From-Learner-Driver-to-Hollywood-Hero.html&gt;</a></p>
<p>What made Daniel Craig’s performance in Casino Royale so good? The answer is simpler than you might think - Craig embodied the essence of James Bond himself and managed to pull off an excellent performance despite having very little acting experience beforehand.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that up until Casino Royale, there had been some doubt over who could potentially take on the iconic role of James Bond - considering that Pierce Brosnan had portrayed him for four films and many felt that it might be difficult to find someone new who could fill those shoes effectively. However, Craig’s portrayal of a darker and edgier 007 won over fans and critics alike - proving that sometimes something new can be just what a series needs in order to stay fresh and interesting.</p>
