#  States Approve Sports Betting in a Bid toBring in Revenue

A majority of U.S. states have now moved to legalize some form of sports betting, in a bid to boost state revenue.

At least 33 states have introduced or passed legislation that would allow sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in 2018, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL).

The move is being driven by struggling state budgets and the hope of capturing some of the estimated $150 billion that is gambled on sports each year in the United States.

“States are looking for any way possible to bring in new revenue, and sports betting is an obvious opportunity,” said Nick Johnson, a fellow at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.

New Jersey, which won the Supreme Court case that overturned the federal ban, has been one of the most aggressive states in moving to legalize gambling on sports.

It has already netted more than $240 million in tax revenue from sports betting since it was first legalized in 2018, according to New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement data.

Pennsylvania, which legalized sports betting in October, brought in more than $10 million in taxes from gambling on sports in its first month alone, according to state data.

Other states are expected to follow suit as they look for ways to shore up budgets hit hard by declining tax revenues and rising costs.

Many states have turned to gambling as a way to fill budget gaps, with casino gaming and lotteries being among the most popular forms of legal gambling.

But there is growing concern that expanding legalized gambling could have negative consequences, including exacerbating addiction problems and contributing to financial instability.

#  States Approve Sports Betting as a Response toThe Supreme Court's Ruling

The Supreme Court's recent ruling to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) has paved the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting. Nevada was the only state that had been allowed to offer full sports betting, but following the Supreme Court's decision, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia have all passed bills to allow some form of sports betting.

The rush to legalize sports betting is in response to the estimated $150 billion that is bet on sports each year outside of legal gambling venues. Much of this money is bet illegally through bookies and offshore websites. The hope is that legalizing and regulating sports betting will bring some of this business back into the legal gambling venues and generate tax revenue for the states.

There are still a few details that need to be worked out in order for sports betting to be fully legalized in these states. For example, New Jersey still needs to create regulations for how bets can be placed and what types of bets are permissible. There is also some disagreement among states about who should be able to offer sports betting. Some states want casinos and racetracks to be the only ones allowed to offer sports betting, while others would like it to be open to other businesses such as bars and restaurants.

Despite these remaining details, it seems likely that Sports betting will soon be legalized in most states in the US. This will provide a new form of entertainment for consumers and generate much-needed tax revenue for state governments.

#  States Approve Sports Betting: What Does itMean for the Future?

As of May 14, 2018, nine states had passed legislation to legalize sports betting. This means that Americans will now be able to legally bet on sporting events, both professional and amateur. The move has been a long time in the making, as many lawmakers feel that sports betting is a form of gambling that should be legalized and regulated.

Advocates for legalizing sports betting argue that it is a form of entertainment that can be enjoyed responsibly. Furthermore, they claim that it can bring in much-needed revenue to state governments. In fact, estimates suggest that legalizing and regulating sports betting could generate up to $6 billion in annual revenue across the country.

Opponents of sports betting argue that it is a dangerous form of gambling that can ruin lives. They also claim that it will lead to corruption in professional and amateur sports.

So what does the legalization of sports betting mean for the future? It remains to be seen how this new development will play out, but there are certainly some potential implications worth considering.

First and foremost, the legalization of sports betting could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates. This is particularly worrisome given that gambling addiction is already a problem in the United States. In fact, about 2% of Americans are estimated to have a gambling addiction.

Another potential consequence of legalized sports betting is an increase in corruption in professional and amateur sports. There is already evidence of this happening; in March 2018, a referee was caught fixing a college basketball game for money. It is likely that this type of behavior will become more common now that people can bet on games legally.

Finally, it is worth noting that the legalization of sports betting could hurt the brick-and-mortar casino industry. This is because people may choose to place their bets online or through mobile apps instead of going to casinos. This could lead to layoffs and closures at brick-and-mortar casinos across the country.

#  Which States Have Approved Sports Betting?

The United States Supreme Court issued a ruling in May 2018 that overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992. The act prohibited states outside of Nevada from authorizing sports betting.

The overturning of PASPA allows each state to decide whether to legalize and regulate sports betting. As of November 2018, 10 states have approved some form of legalized sports betting.

Delaware was the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court ruling, launching its sports betting operation on June 5, 2018. Delaware offers both parlay and single-game wagers on NFL games.

New Jersey quickly followed Delaware’s lead, launching its own sports betting operation a week later on June 13th. New Jersey offers bets on a variety of sporting events, including baseball, basketball, football, hockey, and soccer.

West Virginia was the third state to offer legalized sports betting, launching its operation in August 2018. West Virginia offers bets on NFL and NCAA games.

Mississippi was the fourth state to offer legalized sports betting, launching its operation in August 2018. Mississippi offers bets on a variety of sporting events, including baseball, basketball, football, golf, NASCAR, and soccer.

Rhode Island was the fifth state to offer legalized sports betting, launching its operation in November 2018. Rhode Island offers bets on NFL and NCAA games.

Pennsylvania was the sixth state to offer legalized sports betting, launching its operation in November 2018. Pennsylvania offers bets on NFL games and some college games. 
Arkansas was the seventh state to offer legalized sports betting, launching its operation in December 2018. Arkansas offers single-game wagers on NFL games only .       Missouri is the eighth state to approve sports betting; however, no launch date has been set as of November 2018 .    Illinois is the ninth state to approve sports betting; however there is no timeline for when it will be available .  Oklahoma is the tenth state to legalize sportbooks though Native American tribes will have exclusive rights until late 2019 .

#  More States Join the Movement to ApproveSports Betting After SCOTUS Ruling

The US Supreme Court overturned a 1992 law that prohibited sports betting in most states on May 14, 2018. This ruling has led to a number of states moving to approve sports betting before the start of the NFL season in September.

Oregon, Rhode Island, and Delaware were the first states to take action after the SCOTUS ruling. All three passed legislation to allow sports betting within their state borders. Other states are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks and months.

Nevada has been the only state with legal sports betting since 1992. However, West Virginia is expected to join Nevada as a regulated state within the next few weeks.

The market for legal sports betting is expected to be worth $5.8 billion by 2020, according to a report from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, LLC. That number is up from $2.9 billion in 2015.

The American Gaming Association (AGA), which lobbies for commercial casino operators, already released a statement applauding the SCOTUS decision. John Pappas, Executive Director of the Poker Players Alliance (PPA), also praised the ruling: “Today’s ruling is a victory for poker players and all those who enjoy watching sports and other games unfold before their eyes”

Players will now have more options when it comes to where they can place their bets, which should lead to increased competition and better overall customer experience. The AGA also believes that this ruling could create tens of thousands of new jobs in the gambling industry.
