#  Point out of Nevada raked in over $3.4 billion from sports gambling in 2011!

A recent study showed that the point out of Nevada raked in over $3.4 billion from sports gambling in 2011. This is in addition to the taxes and fees paid by casinos and racetracks. The state also reported that it earned over $1.2 billion in 2009 from legal sports gambling.

The American Gaming Association released a report last year estimating that Americans illegally wagered about $380 billion on sports in 2010. That’s more than twice the amount wagered legally in Nevada that year! So, while legalizing and regulating sports gambling could bring substantial revenue to states, it would not stop Americans from betting on sports illegally.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg expressed his support for legalizing and regulating sports gambling earlier this year. He said, "It's time to legalize betting on professional sports...I think it will make our city fairer, make us a little bit more money, and protect people who are gambling because right now there is no protection."

Do you agree with Mayor Bloomberg? Should the federal government legalize and regulate sports gambling?

#  Casinos in Nevada made more than $1 billion from sports gambling in the month of December 2011!

In a statement released by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, it was revealed that casinos in the state raked in a total of $1.17 billion from sports betting in December 2011. This is the first time that Nevada casinos have cleared the billion-dollar mark in a single month from sports gambling revenue.

It’s not too surprising that Nevada casinos are doing so well from sports wagers, as the state offers some of the most generous betting limits in the country. You can legally bet on NFL games up to $10,000 per game, while college football and basketball bets can be placed up to $5,000 and $1,000 per game, respectively.

This high limit betting is one of the reasons why many professional gamblers choose to make their bets in Nevada rather than offshore websites or other states with limited betting options. In addition, Nevada offers more types of bets than any other state, including proposition bets (such as who will score first), parlays (betting on two or more games at once), and teasers (which tweak point spreads in favor of the gambler).

The booming sports gambling industry is not just limited to Nevada casinos though – online sportsbooks are also seeing record profits. In fact, according to a recent study by research firm Eilers Research LLC, online sportsbooks took in over $2.5 billion in bets last year alone. This number is expected to grow substantially in 2012 as Americans look for more ways to gamble without having to leave their homes.

#  Nevada casinos take in over $10 million each day from sports gambling!

Americans bet more than $500 million on last year’s Super Bowl — and that was just the legally bet amount. All told, Americans are expected to wager more than $10 billion on sports in 2019. So it’s no surprise that Nevada casinos raked in over $10 million each day from sports gambling in 2018!

Nevada legalized sports betting in 1949, and has been reaping the benefits ever since. In fact, during the first half of 2018, Nevada casinos pulled in $1.3 billion from gambling on sports! That’s more than they earned from all other types of gambling combined!

Clearly, sports betting is a big business in Nevada. And as more and more states legalize it, that business is only going to get bigger!

#  Sports betting generates over a quarter of Nevada's total gaming revenue!

Today, sports betting is one of the most popular forms of gambling. The global sports betting market is expected to reach a value of $USD81.08 billion by 2024. In Nevada, where gambling is legal, sports betting generates over a quarter of the state's total gaming revenue!

Most people think of casinos when they think of gambling, but there are many other forms. Lotteries are a popular form of gambling in the United States. The Powerball lottery, for example, has jackpots as high as $1.5 billion! Lotteries are also popular in Europe and Asia.

Online gambling is also becoming increasingly popular. In fact, it is estimated that almost half of all online gamblers place bets on sports games! Many people prefer to gamble online because it is convenient and there are a wide variety of games to choose from.

There are some risks associated with gambling, but if you gamble responsibly and stick to your budget, you can have a lot of fun and maybe even win some money! Gambling can be a great way to escape from reality for a while and enjoy some excitement. Just remember to keep your head up and know when to stop!

#  Nevada takes in more money from sports gambling than any other state in the US!

Nevada has been taking in more money from sports gambling than any other state in the US for years now. In 2017, Nevada took in over $1.3 billion from sports gambling, while the next closest state (New Jersey) took in only $200 million.

This is largely due to the fact that Nevada has had legal sports betting for much longer than any other state. Sports betting was legalized in Nevada in 1949, while it wasn't legalized in any other states until 1992 (when New Jersey passed a law allowing it).

This has given Nevada a considerable edge over other states when it comes to attracting sports gamblers. In fact, a recent study found that nearly two-thirds of all US sports bettors place their bets illegally, and the vast majority of those bets are placed through offshore websites.

This is largely due to the fact that most states don't allow sports betting, and the few states that do have limited options when it comes to where you can place a bet. This isn't the case in Nevada, where you can place a bet on just about any sporting event happening anywhere in the world.

This has given Nevada a considerable edge over other states when it comes to attracting sports gamblers. In fact, a recent study found that nearly two-thirds of all US sports bettors place their bets illegally, and the vast majority of those bets are placed through offshore websites.

With so much money at stake, it's no surprise that many states are now looking to legalize sports betting. In fact, lawmakers in several states have introduced bills that would legalize sports betting in their state. These include:

Illinois
Michigan
New York
Oklahoma
Rhode Island
South Carolina
Tennessee
West Virginia
