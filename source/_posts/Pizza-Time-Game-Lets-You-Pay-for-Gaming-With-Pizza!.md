#  Who Knew Gaming and Pizza Could Go So Well Together?

If you are anything like me, then you love playing video games and eating pizza. In fact, I’d say the two go together quite well. Unfortunately, there just aren’t that many places that combine the two. Sure, you can order pizza for delivery to your house while you are playing games on your console or PC, but that’s not really the same thing as having a pizza place that is tailored specifically for gamers.

Luckily, we now have such a place right here in Toronto. The new Retro Pizza & Gaming Lounge is the perfect spot for gamers and pizza lovers alike. Not only do they have delicious pizza options, but they also have a wide selection of games to choose from. Whether you are into classic arcade games or newer console games, Retro has something for everyone.

I had the chance to check out Retro myself and was really impressed. The atmosphere was perfect for gaming and the staff were super friendly and helpful. They showed me how to use all of the different games and even gave me some tips on how to win. The best part was definitely the food though. The pizza was fantastic and very affordable too.
