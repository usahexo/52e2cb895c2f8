#  Just In! Hollywood Casino Closes In Less Than An Hour!

Pennsylvania's Hollywood Casino in the town of Grantville suddenly closed this morning just shy of an hour after opening its doors to the public. Card dealers, waitstaff, and security personnel were among the first to be let go, followed by the gamblers themselves.

According to management, the casino was forced to close due to a technical issue with its gaming machines. "We are extremely sorry for the inconvenience this has caused our guests," said a spokesperson for the casino. "We are doing everything we can to rectify the situation as quickly as possible."

Guests who had already wagered money on games or slots were given a refund and instructed to leave the premises. Some expressed frustration at losing their hard-earned money while others seemed more understanding. "I'm just glad I got my free breakfast before it all went down," said one guest.

The casino is expected to reopen later today after its technical issues have been resolved.

The Hollywood Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, is scheduled to close at the end of the year. The casino has been in operation since 1994 and is one of the oldest in the state.

#  Hollywood Casino Is About To Close – Get Your Free Coins Now!

It has been a while since I’ve written one of these, but if there is anything that deserves attention it is the looming Hollywood Casino closure.

I know, I know – it’s not the most glamorous topic in the world, but for the sake of all the Pennsylvanians who are about to lose their jobs, it is something that needs to be addressed.

According to recent reports, the Hollywood Casino in Harrisburg is set to close its doors on October 15th. This will leave around 1,000 employees without a job – and that’s just in Harrisburg. The ripple effect of this casino closure will be felt all throughout Pennsylvania.

So what can be done?

One option would be for the state to step in and take over the casino. However, this seems unlikely given the current political climate.

Another option would be for one of the other casinos in the state to open up a satellite location in Harrisburg. This seems more likely, but still no guarantees.

In the meantime, Hollywood Casino is offering free coins to all of its guests! If you have a few minutes, head on over to their website and collect your freebies!

#  End Of An Era! Hollywood Casino Closes Tonight At Midnight!

The Hollywood Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana is set to close its doors for the final time tonight at midnight. This comes after the casino filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month.

The closure of the Hollywood Casino leaves just one tribal casino operating in the state of Indiana, and that is the Foxwoods Casino Resort in French Lick.

This is just another casualty in the ever-growing trend of casinos closing their doors across the United States. Industry experts believe that this is due, in part, to the increasing popularity of legal and regulated online gambling options.

The Hollywood Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana first opened its doors back in 1994. At one time, it was one of the largest casinos in the country, with more than 2,000 slot machines and over 100 table games.

However, in recent years it has seen a decline in business, culminating in last month's bankruptcy filing.
