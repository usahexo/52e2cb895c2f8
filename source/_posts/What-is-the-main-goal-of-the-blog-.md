#  Who created the blog? 
Bloggers are people who write articles and post them on the internet for other people to read. There are many different types of bloggers, but most blogs fall into one of two categories: personal or professional.

Personal bloggers write about their own lives, while professional bloggers offer information or opinion on a particular topic. Some bloggers start out writing personal blogs and eventually switch to professional blogging, while others maintain both personal and professional blogs simultaneously.

The first blog is believed to have been started in 1994 by Justin Hall, who called it “ links.net .” Hall was a student at Swarthmore College at the time, and he used the blog to document his life and share links to interesting websites he came across.

Since then, the blogosphere has exploded with new content and ideas. There are now millions of blogs online, covering every possible topic you can think of. So whatever your interest is, there’s probably a blog out there that covers it in depth.

So who creates these blogs? The answer is anyone with something to say and the desire to share it with the world. Whether you’re a stay-at-home mom looking for a way to connect with other parents, a freelance writer trying to build your portfolio, or just someone with a lot of opinions and something to say, blogging can be a great way to express yourself!

#  How often is it updated? 
In the WordPress ecosystem, one of the common questions asked by users is how often a plugin or theme is updated. This is generally a good indicator of the quality of a plugin or theme. If it has not been updated in a while, it may be abandoned by its developer and contains known security vulnerabilities.

When assessing how frequently a plugin or theme is updated, there are two main types of updates to consider: major and minor. A major update is usually reserved for significant changes, such as adding new features, redesigning the user interface (UI), or fixing bugs. On the other hand, a minor update typically includes bug fixes and small enhancements.

Most WordPress plugins and themes are released with minor updates shortly after they are initially created. However, some developers take much longer to release an update - sometimes years! This can be concerning for users who want to ensure that their site remains secure and performant.

Thankfully, there are several ways to determine how often a plugin or theme is updated. One method is to check the Plugin or Theme Directory on WordPress.org. Simply click on the "Version Info" link under each listing to see when the latest version was released. If it's been over two months since a new version was released, there's a good chance that the author has abandoned the project.

Another great way to determine how often a plugin or theme is updated is by using PlugPlotter, which was created by Tom McFarlin, developer at Pressware and co-host of WordPress Weekly. PlugPlotter aggregates data from GitHub repositories to show when new commits have been made - indicating that an update has been released. It also indicates whether these commits are major or minor updates.

As you can see from the screenshot below, Tom's Slider Revolution plugin has had numerous commits in recent weeks (indicated by the green circles). This suggests that there have been several minor updates released for this plugin. In fact, if you mouse over one of the green circles, you can see that there was a commit on January 1st which was classified as a "minor update."

 

  
  As you can see from PlugPlotter, most of Tom's plugins have multiple commits per week (indicating minor updates). This is reassuring for users who want to use plugins that are actively maintained by their developers .

#  What is the target audience? 

The target audience for this document is people who want to learn about markdown.

# What is markdown? 

Markdown is a formatting syntax that can be used to create documents that are both human-readable and simple to convert into different formats, such as HTML or PDF. It was designed by John Gruber in 2004, and has been gaining in popularity ever since.

# How does markdown work? 

To use markdown, you simply type the text of your document using the special formatting syntax. When you're done writing, you can then convert it into a format like HTML or PDF using a tool called a "markdown converter".

# What are the benefits of using markdown? 

There are several benefits to using markdown: 

- It's easy to learn and use - You don't need any special software or tools to write in markdown, and most converters are easy to use too. 
- It produces clean, semantic markup - Markdown produces HTML that is easy to read and understand, which is important for both humans and search engines. 
- It's portable - You can write your documents in markdown on any device or platform, and they will look the same no matter where you view them.
