#  Supposedly Tax-Free Gambling in Macao Roulette is not so Tax-Free After All! 

The autonomous region of Macao, in southern China, is well known for its legal gambling. In fact, until a few years ago, it was the only place in all of China where casino gambling was legal.

This has made Macao a popular destination for tourists from mainland China and around the world who enjoy trying their luck at one or more of the territory’s several hundred casinos.

And while gambling is still legal in Macao, authorities there are starting to crack down on tax evasion by casino operators. As a result, gambling taxable income is on the rise and some casino players are finding that they are not getting quite the tax-free ride they expected.

Gambling in Macau was once a very simple affair. There were three types of casinos: those restricted to VIPs only; those open to both locals and visitors; and those open only to locals. The rules were also simple: players could bet on any game they wanted and no one could be forced to reveal their hand unless they decided to do so voluntarily.

This laissez faire approach led to rampant cheating by casino staff and players alike. So beginning in 2002, the government enacted a series of new regulations designed to make casino gambling fairer and more transparent.

One of these regulations requires casinos to report taxable income from all games, including roulette. And because Chinese law stipulates that taxpayers must pay income taxes on all forms of gambling winnings, this means that people who play roulette in Macao can now expect to pay taxes on their winnings just as they would if they won playing roulette in Las Vegas or anywhere else in the world.

The amount of tax paid depends on how much profit a casino makes from each individual game. For example, if a casino makes 600 patacas (US $75) profit from a particular game, then the player would be liable for tax on 100 patacas (US $12.50) of that amount. 

Casinos are not required to report losses at this time, but it is likely that losses will also be subject to taxation in the future. So while Macao remains a great place to gamble, it is no longer quite as tax-free as many people may have thought it was!

#  Millionaire Casino Winners Pay Hefty Taxes 

The UNITED STATES Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has reported that a number of high-earning casino winners have had to pay sizable taxes on their winnings in the past year.

Millionaire casino winners who took home more than $1 million in payouts had to pay an average of 39.6 percent of their winnings in taxes, according to the IRS’s 2017 “Highlights of Lottery and Gambling Tax Activity” report. This is a slight increase from the 39 percent averaged in 2016, but is still significantly lower than the top federal income tax rate of 39.6 percent.

The majority of millionaire casino winners were taxed at this top rate, which is applied to individuals who earn more than $400,000 per year. However, a small number of taxpayers earning between $1 million and $5 million per year were taxed at a higher rate of 43.4 percent.

Despite these high rates, the IRS reported that it collected nearly $27 billion in taxes from gambling winnings in 2017. This was a significant increase from the $24 billion collected in 2016 and is likely due to the increasing popularity of casinos and other gambling venues around the country.

So if you’re lucky enough to hit it big at a casino, be prepared to pay up – but also remember that you’re not alone; over 1 million taxpayers across the country had to do the same last year.

#  If You Win a Million Dollars Playing Roulette in Macao, Expect to Pay Up to $265,000 in Tax 

If you hit it big playing roulette in Macao and take home a million dollars, don't expect to keep all of it. Depending on your country's tax laws, you may have to give up a significant portion of your winnings to the government.

In the United States, gambling winnings are considered taxable income. The good news is that you can deduct your losses from your winnings, which can offset some of the taxes you owe. But if you're in the top tax bracket, you'll still have to pay Uncle Sam about $265,000 on a million-dollar win.

In Canada, gambling winnings over C$10,000 are subject to tax at a rate of 50%. So if you take home C$1 million from a lucky roulette spin in Macao, you'll be handing over C$500,000 to the Canadian government.

In the United Kingdom, gambling winnings over £10,000 are taxed at a rate of 20%. So if you hit it big in Macao and bring home £1 million, you'll have to pay £200,000 in taxes.

Australia has one of the most punitive taxation regimes for gambling winnings. Gambling profits over A$1.5 million are subject to a tax rate of 58%. So if you wind up being a millionaire after playing roulette in Macao, expect to pay over A$850,000 in taxes.

So before you head off to Macao to try your luck at the roulette tables, make sure you understand your country's tax laws – and be prepared to hand over a significant chunk of your winnings to the government!

#  Get Ready to Pay Your Taxes if You Win a Million Dollars Playing Roulette in Macao 

If you’re one of the lucky few who hit a million-dollar jackpot while gambling at one of Macao’s world-famous casinos, you might be wondering how much of that money you’ll have to give up to the taxman.

The good news is that, as a foreigner, you won’t have to pay any income tax in Macao on your winnings. However, you will have to pay taxes on your winnings back home if you reside in a country that has income tax laws.

In the United States, for example, the federal government taxes all gambling winnings as ordinary income. That means you’ll likely have to pay between 25% and 39.6% of your winnings in federal taxes, depending on your income bracket.

State governments also levy taxes on gambling winnings, and these rates vary from state to state. In California, for example, taxpayers must pay 33% of their gambling winnings to the state government.

If you live in a country with no income tax laws, you may still be required to pay taxes on your winnings in the country where the casino is located. In Canada, for instance, gambling wins are considered “other income” and are subject to full taxation at the federal level.

So what can you do to reduce your tax bill? One option is to claim your winnings as a business expense. This is often a valid option if you incurred expenses related to your gambling activity, such as travel costs or hotel expenses. You may also be able to deduct losses incurred while gambling from your taxable winnings.

Finally, remember that it’s always important to consult an accountant or tax specialist to ensure that you’re taking advantage of all applicable tax breaks and deductions when filing your return.

#  Winning a Million Dollars at Roulette in Macao Could Cost You Up to $270,000 in Taxes

Imagine winning a million dollars while playing roulette in Macao. It would be an amazing feeling, and you might be tempted to think that the money is all yours. However, as it turns out, you might have to give up a significant chunk of your winnings to the government.

Under Macau's tax laws, any casino winnings over 6,000 patacas (about $746) are subject to a 39 percent tax rate. This means that if you win a million dollars while playing roulette in Macao, you would need to pay taxes totaling $270,000.

While this might seem like a lot of money, it's important to remember that the tax bill is still significantly lower than the taxes you would have to pay on casino winnings in other countries. In the United States, for example, casino winnings are subject to a federal income tax rate of 25 percent plus state taxes. This can result in a tax bill that is significantly higher than the one you would have to pay in Macau.

So if you're thinking about traveling to Macao to try your luck at roulette, make sure you keep these taxes in mind. Although they may reduce your potential profits somewhat, they still represent a much better deal than gambling in other countries.
