#  How to win big in blackjack at Lucky Day!

Do you enjoy playing blackjack? If so, then you'll want to make sure to check out Lucky Day! At Lucky Day, you can win big by playing blackjack. In this article, we'll teach you how to win big in blackjack at Lucky Day.

First and foremost, it's important to note that blackjack is a game of chance. There's no guarantee that you'll win every time you play. However, by following the tips below, you can increase your chances of winning big at blackjack at Lucky Day.

One of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack is to never go over 21. If you go over 21, you automatically lose the game. So make sure to keep track of your cards and know when to stop.

Another important tip is to always split Aces and 8s. By splitting these cards, you have a better chance of winning the game.

In addition, be sure to avoid taking insurance bets. Insurance bets are rarely ever worth it, so it's best to steer clear of them altogether.

## Blackjack basics
1. The basic idea of blackjack is to get as close to 21 points as possible, without going over.
2. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, while face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) are each worth 10 points. An ace can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what is most advantageous for the player.
3. The player and the dealer are both dealt two cards at the beginning of the game. The player’s goal is to beat the dealer by getting closer to 21 points than the dealer does.
4. If the player has a total of 21 points with their first two cards (two aces, for example), they win automatically - this is called a blackjack.
5. If the player goes over 21 points with their first two cards, they bust and lose automatically.
6. If the player’s first two cards equal the dealer’s first two cards, it’s a push and neither wins nor loses.
7. If the player wants another card, they can take it (hit). If they don’t want any more cards, they can stand (not hit).
8. Once both players have finished their hands, the dealer will draw additional cards until they reach 17 or higher - at which point they must stand no matter what their hand total is.
9. The highest ranking hand in blackjack is a blackjack (21 points with your first two cards), followed by an ace-king combination (A-K). Other poker hands are ranked according to standard poker rules.

# How to Count Cards in Blackjack

One of the most important skills for any blackjack player is being able to count cards. This involves keeping track of the number of high and low cards that have been played, so you can make better decisions about when to bet and when to fold.

 beginners can get started by counting each card as it’s played. As you become more confident with counting, you can start counting down from a certain number (e.g. 10) and keeping track of how many cards are left in the deck. This will give you a better idea about when the odds are in your favour and when it might be wise to fold.

# What to Look for in a Blackjack Game

Not all blackjack games are created equal - some offer better odds than others. When choosing a game to play, it’s important to look for those that offer the best chance of winning.

The key factors to look out for include: the number of decks used, whether re-splitting is allowed, whether doubling down is allowed, and whether surrender is an option. Games with fewer decks tend to offer better odds, as do games where re-splitting and doubling down are allowed. Be sure to check these conditions before playing any game!
