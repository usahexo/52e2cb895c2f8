#  Who is the mysterious casino musician in episode 3 of Goliath?

When casino musician Rudy Cardenas pops up in episode 3 of Goliath, he's a complete mystery. Who is he? What's his backstory?

Rudy Cardenas is a Mexican-American musician who has been performing since he was a teenager. He's played in casinos all over the US, and has even toured Europe. His music is described as "soulful and introspective", and he often incorporates Spanish lyrics into his songs.

Cardenas' appearance in Goliath is surprising, considering his background. It's not clear what connection he has to the show or to the characters, but it's possible that his role will be revealed later on in the season. In the meantime, fans are just hoping for more music from Rudy Cardenas!

#  Pizza Time Game musician mystery continues

After the game industry's favorite pizza-themed puzzle game, Pizza Time, released an update with no clear indication of what it means, speculation continues to circulate among fans. Theories include everything from the game's developers teasing a new game to a lengthier countdown timer that will finally unlock the game's secrets.

The latter appears more likely, as evidence has mounted in recent days that something is happening on October 10th. A banner on the Pizza Time website reading "10.10.18" is just one indication, as is a hidden audio clip on the game's website that seems to suggest something new is coming then.

Most tantalizingly, though, is an email sent to players who've completed the game hinting at an upcoming event. "Your support has meant the world to us," it reads. "We hope you can join us for a very special celebration on October 10th." Whether this means a release of some sort or a major fan meetup isn't yet clear, but players are certainly eager to find out.

In the meantime, they're busy discussing and sharing theories in online communities like Reddit and Discord. Some believe that Pizza Time was actually created by Nintendo as part of an elaborate alternate reality game leading up to the release of Super Mario Party - a claim bolstered by Easter eggs found in both games referencing one another.

#  Casino musician in episode 3 of Goliath still a mystery

If you're a fan of the show "Goliath" on Amazon, you no doubt remember the scene in episode 3 where casino musician, Jeremy, is playing the piano and singing. Who is this guy? We still don't know.

There are some theories out there as to who this musician might be. One is that he's actually Billy Batson/Shazam in disguise. This seems unlikely, given that the actor who portrays Billy Batson, Zachary Levi, has already been confirmed as appearing in at least one more episode of Goliath.

Another theory is that Jeremy is actually David's son from a previous relationship. This could make sense, considering that Jeremy looks somewhat like David and knows about his family history. However, there is no confirmation yet that Jeremy is related to David in any way.

We'll just have to wait and see if Jeremy is revealed as someone significant in future episodes of Goliath. In the meantime, we can continue to speculate about his identity.

#  Who is the casino musician in episode 3 of Goliath? We may never know

If you're a fan of the show Goliath, then you likely noticed the casino musician in episode 3. The musician is played by actor and musician, Christopher McDonald. While his role in the show is brief, it's certainly memorable.

Christopher McDonald is a well-known actor and musician. He's starred in films such as Thelma & Louise, Requiem for a Dream, and Happy Gilmore. He's also had roles on popular TV shows such as Law & Order: SVU and True Blood.

As a musician, Christopher McDonald has released several albums. His music has been featured in films such as Thelma & Louise and Erin Brockovich. He has also toured with popular artists such as Bon Jovi and REO Speedwagon.

It's clear that Christopher McDonald is a talented actor and musician. His brief appearance in Goliath was definitely memorable. We can only hope to see more of him in future episodes.

#  The search for the casino musician in episode 3 of Goliath continues

Although the casino musician is not found in episode 3 of Goliath, the search for him continues. The police department, as well as David and his team, are determined to find out who he is and what his motives are. There are several possible explanations for why the musician was in the casino. He could have been there to cause a disturbance, or he could have been there to play music. It's also possible that he was there for another reason entirely.

No matter what his motive was, the casino musician is a potential threat to the public. He needs to be found and arrested so that he can't harm anyone else. David and his team are doing everything they can to locate him, and they're hopeful that they'll be able to apprehend him soon.
