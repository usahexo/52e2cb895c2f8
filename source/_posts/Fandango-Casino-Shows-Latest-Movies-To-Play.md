#  Fandango Casino Shows Latest Movies To Play

Fandango is a site that offers moviegoers the ability to buy tickets and concessions. The company has now announced that it has partnered with several cinemas to offer its customers access to the latest movies.

The first cinema chain to partner with Fandango is AMC. This partnership will provide moviegoers with access to the latest movies as soon as they are released. Theaters that are included in the deal are the AMC Lowes theater chain and the Regal Entertainment Group theater chain.

AMC has been struggling in recent years as more people have chosen to stay at home and watch movies through streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu. This partnership with Fandango could help to revive the business.

Another cinema chain that has partnered with Fandango is Cinemark. This partnership will give moviegoers access to new releases in RealD 3D and Cinemark XD formats. Cinemark XD is a premium format that offers enhanced sound and visuals.

In addition to these two partnerships, Fandango has also announced deals with other theater chains including Southern Theatres, Wehrenberg Theatres, and Malco Theatres. These partnerships will give moviegoers access to new releases in a variety of formats including 2D, 3D, and 4D.

Fandango CEO Paul Yanover had this to say about the company's latest announcements: "We're committed to making sure that fans can see the latest movies in whichever format they choose, whether it's 2D, 3D or IMAX."

Fandango's partnerships with these cinema chains come as no surprise given that the company is looking to expand its business beyond just movie tickets. In recent months, Fandango has been expanding into other areas such as ticketing for concerts and Broadway shows.
