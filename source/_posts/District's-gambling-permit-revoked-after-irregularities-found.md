#  District's gambling permit revoked after irregularities found

The District of Columbia's Gambling Board has revoked the gambling permit of a popular Chinatown casino after irregularities were found.

According to Board Chairperson Myra Wheeless, the casino was found to be in violation of several provisions of the law, including allowing underage gambling and permitting illegal gambling activities.

"This casino was a hot spot for criminal activity," said Wheeless in a statement. "We had no choice but to revoke their permit."

The revocation is a major blow to the casino, which has seen its business decline in recent months. In a statement, the casino's owners said they were "disappointed" by the decision and planned to appeal.

The board's decision comes at a time when the District is seeking to expand its legalized gambling offerings. A bill that would allow table games at three new casinos is currently pending before the City Council.

#  District failed to report nearly $600,000 in gambling income

According to a recent report, the district of Columbia failed to report nearly $600,000 in gambling income over the past two years. The revelation comes as part of an ongoing investigation by the Office of the Inspector General into potential financial mismanagement by the city's government.

The district's failures to report this income is apparently due to a clerical error, and officials are currently working to rectify the situation. In a statement, Mayor Muriel Bowser said that "the District is committed to adhering to all reporting requirements and we are taking steps to ensure this does not happen again."

It's unclear what consequences, if any, the district may face for its failure to report this income. However, officials say that they are taking steps to ensure that it does not happen again. This could include increased training for city staff or changes to the reporting process itself.

In addition to the gambling income, the Office of the Inspector General is also investigating potential financial mismanagement by the district government in other areas. These include spending irregularities at various city agencies and discrepancies between budget projections and actual spending.

#  Gambling permit loss could mean big cuts for district

The Mackinac County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to prohibit all gambling within the county, including charitable and amusement gambling. This leaves the future of the Soaring Eagle Casino & Resort in limbo.

Commissioners said the move was spurred by the state's recent decision to revoke the casino's gambling permit. Without a permit, the casino can't offer any form of gambling, including games of chance and bingo.

This could mean big cuts for the district, which relies heavily on revenue from the casino. In fiscal year 2017, the casino generated $42 million in revenue for the district. That accounted for more than 60 percent of its total revenue.

Casino officials are still exploring their legal options, but they say they may be forced to lay off employees and reduce services if they can't find a way to continue operating without a gambling permit.

Many residents in the district are worried about what this could mean for their community. Several have started petitions calling on commissioners to reverse their decision or find a way to allow the casino to continue operating.

"The Soaring Eagle Casino is not only an important source of jobs and income for our region, it's also a major tourist attraction," said one resident. "If we lose that, it will be devastating for our economy."

Others argue that the casino is a blight on the community and that its impact outweighs its benefits. They say it's time for the district to move on and find other ways to generate revenue.

#  District blames bookkeeper for gambling permit loss

The district has decided to blame their former bookkeeper for the loss of their gambling permit. The permit was lost after an investigation revealed that the bookkeeper had been depositing money earned from the gambling machines into her personal bank account.

The district is hoping that by placing the blame on the former bookkeeper, they can avoid any legal trouble. They are also hoping to avoid any penalties from the state gaming commission.

It is still unclear how much money was deposited into the personal bank account, or how long this has been going on for. However, the district does plan to sue the former bookkeeper in order to recover some of the money that was lost.

#  School district losing gambling permit could be a blessing in disguise

A Pennsylvania school district that had its gambling permit revoked by the state is saying that it might not be a bad thing. The district, which operates a video gambling parlor, lost its permit after an audit revealed that the machines were being used for illegal purposes.

Now, the district says that it may be better off without the permit, as it will now be able to run the parlor without paying any fees to the state. In addition, the district could now potentially make more money from the gambling operation, as it will not be subject to any regulations or restrictions.

While some people in the community are upset about the loss of the gambling permit, others say that it is a good thing, as it will help to keep the district from going into debt. The district has been struggling financially in recent years, and officials say that they are hopeful that the gambling parlor will help to stabilize their budget.
